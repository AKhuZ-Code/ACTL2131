# Built with...

• R (ggplot2)

# Motivation 

Requirements summary:

<b> • Summary statistics and graphical analysis on all 7 variables </b>

<b> • Normality test on some log-transformed variables </b>

<b> • Hypothesis testing on the mean of certain distributions </b>

<b> • Simple Linear Regression model </b>

<b> • Multiple Linear Regression model </b>
  
# Summary of Code
  
  • All visualisations and regression models are created using R - normality testing and hypothesis testing were done by inspection of visualisations and by-hand calculations respectively
  
# Summary of Results
  
(from the report)

  • Adjusted R-squared of MLR > 0.9

  • It is recommended that companies in the UI industry should make use of a Multiple Linear Regression model for making predictions/inferences, as our analysis shows that the model (with response being the Benefits Paid) fits well with the data. Moreover, it can consider a wide range of causal factors.
  
  • It is also recommended that the model is retrained with the latest data on a regular basis to ensure optimal fit.
